## Context

This is exercise three of DOM manipulation in our Javascript intro. The assignment is to create a simple HTML page with two columns with business hours and bus open/closed. We are to have a live updating clock that is digital. We have to have a button that says close early and if pressed changes the closing time of the current day to the current time. 
I chose to use the example of a website, and have included a picture of a 'restaurant setting' as the background image.

No installation needed, I used Sublime Text as a text editor and always loaded website on Google Chrome ( so it behaves best in this web browser)
All of the code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
