## Context

This is exercise three of DOM manipulation in our Javascript intro. The assignment is to create a simple HTML page with two columns with business hours and bus open/closed. We are to have a live updating clock that is digital. We have to have a button that says close early and if pressed changes the closing time of the current day to the current time. 
I chose to use the example of a website, and have included a picture of a 'restaurant setting' as the background image.

## Instructions

* Create a simple html page
* Add some styling so it looks good
* Add two columns:
* One column has a table containing the business hours of a company (just pick some random business hours)
* The second column has a simple paragraph, containing a phrase declaring the business currently open / closed.
* When you load the page:
* Check the day, Check the time, Compare it to the business hours, Declare if the business is open

## BONUS Objective
* Add a live updating clock of the current time (digital)
* Add a button "Close early"
* When you click this button, the current day's business hours end at the current time in the table (So on thursday if I click this button at 14:45, the table's business hours for thursday will change to end at 14:45)
