# Serious-Business
This is exercise three of DOM manipulation in our Javascript intro. The assignment is to create a simple HTML page with two columns with business hours and bus open/closed. We are to have a live updating clock that is digital. We have to have a button that says close early and if pressed changes the closing time of the current day to the current time.
